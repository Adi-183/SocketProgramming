Application #3: Base64 encoding system using Client-Server socket programming
The submission includes 3 files: Server.c, Client.c, Readme
How to run:
Open first terminal and run: gcc -o s Server.c
run: ./s 8000 (Any valid port number can be provided)
Open another terminal and run: gcc -o c Client.c
run: ./c 127.0.0.1 8000
Now if you type a message it will get encoded then sent to Server using tcp and it will be printed by server(original and decoded messages) then server sends a acknowledgement message to client and client prints it.
If client wants to close the communication it can type "Bye", this will send a type 3 message to server indicating it to close the connection.
The server is concurrent server i.e. it can service multiple clients at once.
